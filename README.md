## Introduction
Facial recognition is a biometric method that uses the unique features of a person's face to identify them. This project demonstrates the application of facial recognition using Python, OpenCV, and other libraries.

## Features
- Face detection in images and videos
- Face recognition using pre-trained models
- Real-time face recognition using a webcam
- Support for multiple faces in a single image/video
- Ability to add new faces to the recognition database

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition.git
cd facial-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
